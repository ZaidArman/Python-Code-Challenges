Hi I'm Zaid Ullah, today i am going to solve the Python Code Challenges
One of the best ways to test and practice your skills with Python is by solving coding challenges. You can learn a lot from books and online courses, but coding isn't an armchair activity. You have to write some code to make genuine progress.

Coding challenges are perfect for this. Coding challenges are small problems you can solve with code. Just because they're small doesn't mean they won't put your knowledge to the test. Each bite-size challenge will focus on skills that you'll use later working on complete software projects.

In this article, we'll give you 10 beginner Python coding challenges to get you started. Try one or two a day to keep your Python skills sharp.
